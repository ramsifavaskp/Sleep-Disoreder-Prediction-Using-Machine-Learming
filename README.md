Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning repository! This project aims to predict sleep disorders in individuals based on various factors using machine learning techniques. It involves Python programming, Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, HTML for visualization, and Python for machine learning modeling.

Overview
The Sleep Disorder Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict sleep disorders in individuals. It involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant data related to sleep patterns, lifestyle factors, medical history, etc.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the data to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering relevant features that contribute to predicting sleep disorders.
Model Building: Training machine learning models on the prepared dataset to predict sleep disorders accurately.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface (HTML) to interact with the trained machine learning model.
Features
Data Visualization: Visualizing sleep-related data using HTML for better understanding and interpretation.
Machine Learning Modeling: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to predict sleep disorders.
User Interface: Providing a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their data and get predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Used for data analysis, machine learning modeling, and scripting.
Jupyter Notebook: Utilized for interactive data analysis and visualization.
HTML: Employed for creating the user interface for interaction.
Machine Learning Libraries: Such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for building and training machine learning models.
Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ramsifavaskp/Sleep-Disoreder-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learling.git
Navigate to the CMP directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Sleep-Disoreder-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learling/CMP
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Sleep_Disorder_Prediction.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and analyze the data, preprocess it, build machine learning models, and evaluate them.

After selecting the best model, deploy it using Python and HTML for creating the user interface.
